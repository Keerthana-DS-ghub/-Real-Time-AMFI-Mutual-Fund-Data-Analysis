# üìä Real-Time AMFI Mutual Fund Data Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on real-time analysis of mutual fund data sourced directly from the [Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI)](https://www.amfiindia.com/). It automates the data extraction, cleans and transforms it using Python, stores it in a MySQL database, and provides live insights via Power BI dashboards

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

üêç Python ‚Äî For automation, data processing, and integration

üßÆ Pandas ‚Äî Powerful data manipulation and transformation

üóÑÔ∏è MySQL ‚Äî Structured data storage with real-time updates

üìä Power BI ‚Äî Interactive dashboards for insightful visual analytics

## üß† Key Features
- üîÑ **Automated Data Extraction**: Scrapes mutual fund NAV data from AMFI's online source at regular intervals using Python.
- üßπ **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Utilizes Pandas to clean, format, and structure the raw data for downstream analysis.
- üóÉÔ∏è **MySQL Integration**: Inserts and maintains cleaned data in a MySQL database with real-time update capabilities.
- üìà **Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)**: Visualizes mutual fund trends, performance comparisons, and historical changes, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

## üí° Impact
> Provided stakeholders with **live insights** into mutual fund trends and enabled **real-time comparison** across various funds, facilitating more informed financial decisions.

## üèÅ Final Thoughts
This project reflects my passion for building real-time, data-driven solutions that turn raw information into actionable insights. By automating mutual fund data extraction, maintaining a robust backend in MySQL, and visualizing trends through Power BI, I‚Äôve created an end-to-end pipeline that empowers informed financial decision-making.

I‚Äôm excited to continue exploring the intersection of data engineering and analytics to solve real-world challenges.
